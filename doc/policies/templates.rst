Policy Templates
----------------

.. index:: policies, policy templates

Policy templates are defined in a Github repository which can be changed
using a WebUI policy :ref:`policy_template_url`.
The templates are fetched from the given repository URL during runtime.

The policy templates are json files, which can contain common settings that
can be used to start your own polices. When creating a new policy, you can
select an existing policy template as a starting point.

You may also fork the github repository and create a pull request to improve
the policy templates. Or you may fork the github repository and use your own
policy template URL for your policy templates.

A policy template looks like this::

   {
    "name": "template_name1",
    "scope": "enrollment",
    "action": {
      "tokenlabel": "{user}@{realm}/{serial}",
      "autoassignment": true
    }
   }

*realms*, *resolver* and *clients* are not used in the templates.

A template must be referenced in a special ``index.json`` file::

   {
     "template_name1": "description1",
     "template_name2": "description2"
   }

where the key is the name of the template file and the value is a description
displayed in the WebUI.
