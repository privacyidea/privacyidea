Admin policies
--------------

.. index:: admin policies, superuser realm, admin realm, help desk

Admin policies are used to regulate the actions that administrators are
allowed to do.
Technically admin policies control the use of the REST
API :ref:`rest_token`, :ref:`rest_system`, :ref:`rest_realm` and
:ref:`rest_resolver`.

Admin policies are implemented as decorators in :ref:`code_policy` and
:ref:`policy_decorators`.

Starting with privacyIDEA 2.4 admin policies can also store a field "admin
realm". This is used, if you define realms to be superuser realms. See
:ref:`cfgfile` for information how to do this. Read :ref:`faq_admins` for
more information on the admin realms.

This way it is easy to define administrative rights for big groups of
administrative users like help desk users in the IT department.

.. figure:: images/admin_policies.png
   :width: 500

   *The Admin scope provides an additional field 'admin realm'.*

All administrative actions also refer to the defined user realm. Meaning
an administrator may have many rights in one user realm and only a few
rights in another realm.

Creating a policy with ``scope:admin``, ``admin-realm:helpdesk``,
``user:frank``, ``action:enable`` and ``realm:sales``
means that the administrator *frank* in the admin-realm *helpdesk* is allowed
to enable tokens in the user-realm *sales*.

.. note:: As long as no admin policy is defined all administrators
   are allowed to do everything.

.. note:: Admin policies are also checked for all local administrators.

The following actions are available in the scope
*admin*:

tokenlist
~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

This allows the administrator to list existing tokens in the specified user realm.
Note, that the resolver in this policy is ignored.

If the policy with the action ``tokenlist`` is not bound to any user realm, this acts
as a wild card and the admin is allowed to list all tokens.

If the action ``tokenlist`` is not active, but admin policies exist, then the admin
is not allowed to list any tokens.

.. note:: As with all boolean policies, multiple *tokenlist* policies add up to
   create the resulting rights of the administrator.
   So if there are multiple matching policies for different realms,
   the admin will have list rights on all mentioned realms
   independent on the priority of the policies.

enroll
~~~~~~

type: bool

There are enrollment actions per token type, e.g. ``enrollHOTP``. Only those token
types are selectable in the WebUI during enrollment which are allowed by their
corresponding enroll policy action.

enable
~~~~~~

type: bool

The ``enable`` action allows the administrator to activate
disabled tokens.

disable
~~~~~~~

type: bool

Tokens can be enabled and disabled. Disabled tokens can not be
used to authenticate. The ``disable`` action allows the
administrator to disable tokens.

revoke
~~~~~~

type: bool

Tokens can be revoked. Usually this means the token is disabled and locked.
A locked token can not be modified anymore. It can only be deleted.

Certain token types like *certificate* may define special actions when
revoking a token.

set
~~~

type: bool

Tokens can have additional token information, which can be
viewed in the :ref:`token_details`.

If the ``set`` action is defined, the is administrator allowed
to set those token properties like ``description``, ``max_failcount``
or ``validity_period_start`` at the ``/token/set`` endpoints
(see :ref:`rest_token`).

setdescription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

The admin is allowed to set the description of tokens via the endpoint `/token/descriptipon`.

.. note:: That an admin can also be allowed to the the description of a token by granting the
   before mentioned policy `set`.

setpin
~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``setpin`` action is defined, the administrator
is allowed to set the OTP PIN of a token.

setrandompin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``setrandompin`` action is defined, the administrator
is allowed to call the endpoint, that sets a random token PIN.

settokeninfo
~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

The administrator is allowed to manually set and delete token info.

enrollpin
~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the action ``enrollpin`` is defined, the administrator
can set a token PIN during enrollment. If the action is not defined and
the administrator tries to set a PIN during enrollment, this PIN is deleted
from the request.

hide_tokeninfo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This specifies a blank-separated list of tokeninfo keys, which should be removed
from the response and therefore will not be shown in the WebUI or JSON response.

For example a value ``tokenkind auto_renew`` will hide these two tokeninfo entries.

otp_pin_maxlength
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: PIN policy, Token specific PIN policy

type: integer

range: 0 - 31

This is the maximum allowed PIN length the admin is allowed to
use when setting the OTP PIN.

.. note:: There can be token type specific policies like
   ``spass_otp_pin_maxlength``, ``spass_otp_pin_minlength`` and
   ``spass_otp_pin_contents``. If suche a token specific policy exists, it takes
   priority of the common PIN policy.

otp_pin_minlength
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: integer

range: 0 - 31

This is the minimum required PIN the admin must use when setting the
OTP PIN.

.. _admin_policies_otp_pin_contents:

otp_pin_contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

contents: cns

This defines what characters an OTP PIN should contain when the admin
sets it.

**c** are letters matching [a-zA-Z].

**n** are digits matching [0-9].

**s** are special characters matching [\[\].:,;-_<>+*!/()=?$ยง%&#~\^].

**[allowedchars]** is a specific list of allowed characters.

**Example:** The policy action ``otp_pin_contents=cn, otp_pin_minlength=8`` would
require the admin to choose OTP PINs that consist of letters and digits
which have a minimum length of 8.

``cn``

   *test1234* and *test12$$* would be valid OTP PINs. *testABCD* would
   not be a valid OTP PIN.

The logic of the ``otp_pin_contents`` can be enhanced and reversed using the
characters ``+`` and ``-``.

``-cn`` (denial)

   The PIN must not contain a character and must not contain a number.
   *test1234* would not be a valid PIN, since it does contains numbers and characters.
   *test///* would not be a valid PIN, since it contains characters.

``-s`` (denial)

   The PIN must not contain a special character.
   *test1234* would be a valid PIN. *test12$$* would not.

``+cn`` (grouping)

   combines the two required groups. I.e. the OTP PIN should contain
   characters from the sum of the two groups.
   *test1234*, *test12$$*, *test*
   and *1234* would all be valid OTP PINs.
   Note, how this is different to ``-s``, since it allows special characters to be
   included.

``[123456]``

   allows the digtits 1-6 to be used.
   *1122* would be a valid PIN.
   *1177* would not be a valid PIN.


otp_pin_set_random
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: integer

range: 1-31

The administrator can set a random pin for a token
with the endpoint ``token/setrandompin``.
This policy is needed to define how long the PIN will be.

.. note:: The PIN will consist of digits and letters.

reset
~~~~~

type: bool

The administrator is allowed to reset the fail counter of a token.

resync
~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``resync`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to resynchronize a token.

assign
~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``assign`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to assign a token to a user. This is used for
assigning an existing token to a user but also to
enroll a new token to a user.

Without this action, the administrator can not create
a connection (assignment) between a user and a token.

unassign
~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``unassign`` action is defined, the administrator
is allowed to unassign tokens from a user. I.e. the
administrator can remove the link between the token
and the user. The token still continues to exist in the system.

importtokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``importtokens`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to import token seeds from a token file, thus
creating many new token objects in the systems database.

The right to upload tokens can be limited to certain realms.
Thus the administrator could only upload tokens into realm he is allowed to manage.

delete
~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``delete`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to delete a token from the system.

.. note:: If a token is deleted, it can not be recovered.

.. note:: All audit entries of this token still exist in the audit log.

spass_otp_pin_contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: str

.. _spass-otp-pin-minlength:
.. _spass-otp-pin-maxlength:


spass_otp_pin_minlength and spass_otp_pin_maxlength
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: int

These policy actions define the required minimal and allowed maximal pin length
for :ref:`spass_token`.

userlist
~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``userlist`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to view the user list in a realm.
An administrator might not be allowed to list the users, if
he should only work with tokens, but not see all users at once.

.. note:: If an administrator has any right in a realm, the administrator
   is also allowed to view the token list.

getchallenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``getchallenges`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to check the status of open challenge requests.

tokenrealms
~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``tokenrealms`` action is defined, the administrator is allowed
to manage the realms of a token.

A token may be located in multiple realms. This can be interesting if
you have a pool of spare tokens and several realms but want to
make the spare tokens available to several realm administrators.
(Administrators, who have only rights in one realm)

Then all administrators can see these tokens and assign the tokens.
But as soon as the token is assigned to a user in one realm, the
administrator of another realm can not manage the token anymore.

.. _tokengroups:

tokengroups
~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``tokengroups`` action is defined, the administrator is allowed to
manage the tokengroups of a token.

Tokens can be grouped into tokengroups, so that such tokens can be more easily
addressed in certain situations.

Administrators can also be allowed to define tokengroups and delete tokengroup definitions.

tokengroup_list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

This allows the administrator to list all defined tokengroups.

tokengroup_add
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the policy ``tokengroup_add`` is defined, the administrator is allowed to
define new tokengroups.

tokengroup_delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

delete existing tokengroup definitions.

.. _policy_serviceids:

serviceid_add
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

.. index:: service ID

This policy allows the administrator to add a new service ID to the list of
defined services. These service IDs can then be used in attaching SSH keys or can be used with
application specific passwords.

See :ref:`serviceids`

serviceid_delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

This policy allows the administrator to delete a service ID definition.

servivceid_list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

This policy allows the administrator to list all defined service IDs.

~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

.. index:: getserial

If the ``getserial`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to calculate the token serial number for a given OTP
value.


getrandom
~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

.. index:: getrandom

The ``getrandom`` action allows the administrator to retrieve random
keys from the endpoint *getrandom*. This is an endpoint in :ref:`rest_system`.

*getrandom* can be used by the client, if the client has no reliable random
number generator. Creating API keys for the Yubico Validation Protocol uses
this endpoint.

getchallenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

.. index:: getchallenges

This policy allows the administrator to retrieve a list of active challenges
of a challenge response tokens. The administrator can view these challenges
in the web UI.

.. _lost_token:

losttoken
~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

allowed to perform the lost token process.

To only perform the lost token process the actions ``copytokenuser``
and ``copytokenpin`` are not necessary!


adduser
~~~~~~~

type: bool

.. index:: Add User, Users

If the ``adduser`` action is defined, the administrator is allowed to add
users to a user store.

.. note:: The user store still must be defined as editable, otherwise no
   users can be added, edited or deleted.

~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: Edit User

type: bool

If the ``updateuser`` action is defined, the administrator is allowed to edit
users in the user store.

deleteuser
~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: Delete User

type: bool

If the ``deleteuser`` action is defined, the administrator is allowed to
delete an existing user from the user store.


copytokenuser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``copytokenuser`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to copy the user assignment of one token to another.

This functionality is also used during the lost token process.
But you only need to define this action, if the administrator
should be able to perform this task manually.

copytokenpin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If the ``copytokenpin`` action is defined, the administrator is
allowed to copy the OTP PIN from one token to another without
knowing the PIN.

This functionality is also used during the lost token process.
But you only need to define this action, if the administrator
should be able to perform this task manually.

contain this very user realm. A list of user realms may be defined.

To learn more about the audit log, see :ref:`audit`.

auditlog_download
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

The administrator is allowed to download the audit log.

.. note:: The download is **not** restricted to filters, hidden columns and audit age.
   Thus, if you want to avoid, that an administrator can see older
   logs or columns, hidden by `hide_audit_columns`, you need to disallow downloading the data.
   Otherwise he may download the audit log and look at older entries manually.

auditlog_age
~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This limits the maximum age of displayed audit entries. Older entries are not
remove from the audit table but the administrator is simply not allowed to
view older entries.

Can be something like 10m (10 minutes), 10h (10 hours) or 10d (ten days).

hide_audit_columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This species a blank separated list of audit columns, that should be removed
from the response and also from the WebUI.

If set the administrator is allowed to call the API
``/validate/triggerchallenge``. This API can be used to send an OTP SMS to
user without having specified the PIN of the SMS token.

The usual setup that one administrative account has only this single policy
and is only used for triggering challenges.

New in version 2.17.

.. _totp-2step:

hotp_2step and totp_2step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This allows or forces the administrator to enroll a smartphone based token in two steps.
In the second step the smartphone generates a part of the OTP secret, which the administrator
needs to enter. (see :ref:`2step_enrollment`).
Possible values are *allow* and *force*.
This works in conjunction with the enrollment parameters :ref:`2step_parameters`.

Such a policy can also be set for the user. See :ref:`user_policy_2step`.

.. note:: This does not work in combination with the enrollment policy :ref:`policy_verify_enrollment`, since
   the usage of 2step already ensures, that the user has successfully scanned the QR code.

.. _hotp-hashlib:
.. _totp-hashlib:

hotp_hashlib and totp_hashlib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

Force the admin to enroll HOTP/TOTP Tokens with the specified hashlib.

wide in the token settings.
This policy takes a blank-separated list of configured SMS gateways.
It allows the administrator to define an individual SMS gateway during token enrollment.

New in version 3.0.

indexedsecret_force_attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

If an administrator enrolls an indexedsecret token then the value of the given
user attribute is set as the secret.
The admin does not know the secret and can not change the secret.

For more details of this token type see :ref:`indexedsecret_token`.

New in version 3.3.

.. _admin_trusted_attestation_CA:

certificate_trusted_Attestation_CA_path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

An administrator can enroll a certificate token for a user.
If an attestation certificate is provided in addition, this policy holds the
path to a directory, that contains trusted CA paths.

at the first position and the consecutive intermediate certificates.

An additional enrollment policy :ref:`require_attestation`, if an attestation certificate
is required.

New in version 3.5.

.. _admin_set_custom_user_attributes:

set_custom_user_attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

New in version 3.6

This policy defines which additional attributes an administrator is allowed to set.
It can also define, to which value the admin is allowed to set such attribute.
For allowing all values, the asterisk ("*") is used.

.. note:: Commas are not allowed in policy actions value, so the setting has to
   be defined by separating colons (":") and spaces.

Each key is enclosed in colons and followed by a list of values separated by whitespaces,
thus values are not allowed to contain whitespaces.

Example:

    ``:department: sales finance :city: * :*: 1 2``

``:department: sales finance`` means that the administrator can set an additional
attribute "department" with the allowed values of "sales" or "finance".

``:city: *`` means that the administrator can set an additional attribute
"city" to any value.

``:*: 1 2`` means that the administrator can set any other additional attribute
either to the value "1" or to the value "2".


.. _admin_delete_custom_user_attributes:

delete_custom_user_attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This takes a space separated list of attributes that the administrator is allowed to
delete. You can use the asterisk "*" to indicate, that this policy allows the
administrator to delete any additional attribute.

Example:

    ``attr1 attr2 department``

The administrator is allowed to delete the attributes "attr1", "attr2" and
the attributes "department" of the corresponding users.
