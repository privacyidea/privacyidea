.. _authentication_policies:

Authentication policies
-----------------------

.. index:: authentication policies

The scope *authentication* gives you more detailed
possibilities to authenticate the user or to define
what happens during authentication.

Technically the authentication policies apply
to the REST API :ref:`rest_validate` and are checked
using :ref:`code_policy` and
:ref:`policy_decorators`.

The following actions are available in the scope
*authentication*:

.. _otppin_policy:

otppin
~~~~~~

type: string

This action defines how the fixed password part during
authentication should be validated.
Each token has its own OTP PIN, but you can choose
how the authentication should be processed:

``otppin=tokenpin``

   This is the default behaviour. The user needs to
   pass the OTP PIN concatenated with the OTP value.

``otppin=userstore``

   The user needs to pass the user store password
   concatenated with the OTP value. It does not matter
   if the OTP PIN is set or not.
   If the user is located in an Active Directory the user
   needs to pass his domain password together with the
   OTP value.

.. note:: The domain password is checked with an LDAP
   bind right at the moment of authentication.
   So if the user is locked or the password was
   changed authentication will fail.

``otppin=none``

   The user does not have to pass any fixed password.
   Authentication is only done via the OTP value.

.. _passthru_policy:

passthru
~~~~~~~~

.. index:: passthru, migration

type: str

If the user has no token assigned, he will be authenticated
against the userstore or against the given RADIUS configuration.
I.e. the user needs to provide the LDAP- or SQL-password or valid credentials
for the RADIUS server.

.. note:: This is a good way to do a smooth enrollment.
   Users having a token enrolled will have to use the
   token, users not having a token, yet, will be able
   to authenticate with their domain password.

   It is also a way to do smooth migrations from other OTP systems.
   The authentication request of users without a token is forwarded to the
   specified RADIUS server.

.. note:: The passthru policy overrides the authorization policy
   for :ref:`tokentype_policy`. I.e. a user may authenticate due
   to the passthru    policy (since he has no token)
   although a tokentype policy is active!

.. warning:: If the user has the right to delete his
   tokens in selfservice portal, the user could
   delete all his tokens and then authenticate with
   his static password again.

passthru_assign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: passthru, migration

type: str

This policy is only evaluated, if the policy ``passthru`` is set.
If the user is authenticated against a RADIUS server, then privacyIDEA
splits the sent password into PIN and OTP value and tries to find an unassigned token,
that is in the user's realm by using the OTP value. If it can identify this token, it assigns this
token to the user and sets the sent PIN.

The policy is configured with a string value, that contains
* the position of the PIN
* the OTP length and
* the number of OTP values tested for each unassigned token (optional, default=100).

Examples are

* ``8:pin`` would be an eight digit OTP value followed by the PIN
* ``pin:6:10000`` would be the PIN followed by an 6 digit OTP value, 10.000
  otp values would be checked for each token.

.. note:: This method can be used to automatically migrated tokens from an old system
   to privacyIDEA. The administrator needs to import all seeds of the old tokens
   and put the tokens in the user's realm.

.. warning:: This can be very time consuming if the OTP values to check is set to high!


.. _passonnotoken:

passOnNoToken
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: passOnNoToken

type: bool

If the user has no token assigned an authentication request
for this user will always be true.

.. warning:: Only use this if you know exactly what
   you are doing.

passOnNoUser
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: passOnNoUser

type: bool

If the user does not exist, the authentication request is successful.

.. warning:: Only use this if you know exactly what you are doing.



smstext
~~~~~~~

.. index:: SMS policy, SMS text

type: string

This is the text that is sent via SMS to the user trying to
authenticate with an SMS token.
You can use the tags *<otp>* and *<serial>*.
Texts containing whitespaces must be enclosed in single quotes.

Starting with version 2.20 you can use the tag *{challenge}*. This will add
the challenge data that was passed in the first authentication request in the
challenge parameter. This could contain banking transaction data.

In the :ref:`sms_gateway_config` the tag *{otp}* will be replaced by the custom
message, set with this policy.

Default: *<otp>*

smsautosend
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: SMS automatic resend

type: bool

A new OTP value will be sent via SMS if the user authenticated
successfully with his SMS token. Thus the user does not
have to trigger a new SMS when he wants to login again.


emailtext
~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: EMail policy, Email text

type: string

This is the text that is sent via Email to be used with Email Token. This
text should contain the OTP tag.

The text can contain the following tags, that will be filled:

  * {otp} or *<otp>* the One-Time-Password
  * {serial} or *<serial>* the serial number of the token.
  * {user} the given name of the token owner.
  * {givenname} the given name of the token owner.
  * {surname} the surname of the token owner.
  * {username} the loginname of the token owner.
  * {userrealm} the realm of the token owner.
  * {tokentype} the type of the token.
  * {recipient_givenname} the given name of the recipient.
  * {recipient_surname} the surname of the recipient.
  * {time} the current server time in the format HH:MM:SS.
  * {date} the current server date in the format YYYY-MM-DD

Starting with version 2.20 you can use the tag *{challenge}*. This will add
the challenge data that was passed in the first authentication request in the
challenge parameter. This could contain banking transaction data.

Default: *<otp>*

You can also provide the filename to an email template. The filename must be prefixed with
``file:`` like ``file:/etc/privacyidea/emailtemplate.html``. The template is
an HTML file.

.. note:: If a message text is supplied directly, the email is sent as plain text.
   If the email template is read from a file, a HTML-only email is sent instead.

emailsubject
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: Email policy, Email subject

type: string

This is the subject of the Email sent by the Email Token.
You can use the same tags as mentioned in ``emailtext``.

Default: Your OTP

emailautosend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: Email policy

type: bool

If set, a new OTP Email will be sent, when successfully authenticated with an
Email Token.


.. _policy_mangle:

mangle
~~~~~~

.. index:: Mangle authentication request, Mangle policy

type: string

The ``mangle`` policy can mangle the authentication request data before they
are processed. I.e. the parameters ``user``, ``pass`` and ``realm`` can be
modified prior to authentication.

This is useful if either information needs to be stripped or added to such a
parameter.
To accomplish that, the mangle policy can do a regular expression search and
replace using the keyword *user*, *pass* (password) and *realm*.

A valid action could look like this::

   action: mangle=user/.*(.{4})/user\\1/

This would modify a username like "userwithalongname" to "username", since it
would use the last four characters of the given username ("name") and prepend
the fixed string "user".

This way you can add, remove or modify the contents of the three parameters.
For more information on the regular expressions see [#pythonre]_.

.. note:: You must escape the backslash as **\\\\** to refer to the found
   substrings.

**Example**: A policy to remove whitespace characters from the realm name would
look like this::

   action: mangle=realm/\\s//

**Example**: If you want to authenticate the user only by the OTP value, no
matter what OTP PIN he enters, a policy might look like this::

   action: mangle=pass/.*(.{6})/\\1/

**Example**: If you want to strip a string from the front of a username, for
example to have "admin_username" resolve to just "username", it would look like
this::

   action: mangle=user/admin_(.*)/\\1/

.. _policy_challenge_response:

challenge_response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This is a list of token types for which challenge response can
be used during authentication. The list is separated by whitespaces like
*"hotp totp"*.

.. _policy_change_pin_via_validate:

change_pin_via_validate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

This works with the enrollment policies :ref:`policy_change_pin_first_use` and
:ref:`policy_change_pin_every`. When a PIN change is due, then a successful authentication
will start a challenge response mechanism in which the user is supposed to enter a new
PIN two times.

Only if the user successfully changes the PIN the authentication process is finished
successfully. E.g. if the user enters two different new PINs, the authentication process will fail.

.. note:: The application must support several consecutive challenge response requests.


.. _policy_u2f_facets:

u2f_facets
~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This is a white space separated list of domain names, that are trusted to
also use a U2F device that was registered with privacyIDEA.

You need to specify a list of FQDNs without the https scheme like:

*"host1.example.com host2.example.com firewall.example.com"*

For more information on configuring U2F see :ref:`u2f_token`.


.. [#pythonre] https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html


reset_all_user_tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: bool

If a user authenticates successfully all failcounter of all of his tokens
will be reset. This can be important, if using empty PINs or *otppin=None*.


.. _policy_auth_cache:

auth_cache
~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: AuthCache, Authentication Cache

type: string

The Authentication Cache caches the credentials of a successful
authentication and allows to use the same credentials - also with an OTP
value - for the specified amount of time.

The time to cache the credentials can be specified like "4h", "5m", "2d"
(hours, minutes days) or "4h/5m". The notation 4h/5m means, that credentials
are cached for 4 hours, but only may be used again, if every 5 minutes the
authentication occurs. If the authentication with the same credentials would
not occur within 5 minutes, the credentials can not be used anymore.

In future implementations the caching of the credentials could also be
dependent on the clients IP address and the user agent.

.. note:: Cache entries are written to the database table ``authcache``. Please note
   that expired entries are automatically deleted only when the user
   attempts to log in with the same expired credentials again. In all other cases,
   expired entries need to be deleted from this table manually by running::

      pi-manage authcache cleanup --minutes MIN

   which deletes all cache entries whose last authentication has occurred at least
   ``MIN`` minutes ago. As an example::

      pi-manage authcache cleanup --minutes 300

   will delete all authentication cache entries whose last authentication happened more
   than 5 hours ago.

   It may make sense to create a cronjob that periodically cleans up old authentication cache entries.

.. note:: The AuthCache only works for user authentication, not for
   authentication with serials.

.. _policy_push_text_on_mobile:

push_text_on_mobile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: push token, Firebase service

type: string

This is the text that should be displayed on the push notification
during the login process with a :ref:`push_token`.
You can choose different texts for different users or IP addresses.
This way you could customize push notifications for different applications.

.. _policy_push_title_on_mobile:

push_title_on_mobile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: push token, Firebase service

type: string

This is the title of the push notification that is displayed
on the user's smartphone during the login process with
a :ref:`push_token`.

.. _policy_push_wait:

push_wait
~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: push token, push direct authentication

type: int

This can be set to a number of seconds. If this is set, the authentication
with a push token is only performed via one request to ``/validate/check``.
The HTTP request to ``/validate/check`` will wait up to this number of
seconds and check, if the push challenge was confirmed by the user.

This way push tokens can be used with any non-push-capable applications.

Sensible numbers might be 10 or 20 seconds.

.. note:: This behaviour can interfere with other tokentypes. Even if
   the user also has a normal HOTP token, the ``/validate/check`` request
   will only return after this number of seconds.

.. warning:: Using simple webserver setups like Apache WSGI this actually
   can block all available worker threads, which will cause privacyIDEA
   to become unresponsive if the number of open PUSH challenges exceeds
   the number of available worker threads!


.. _policy_auth_push_allow_poll:

push_allow_polling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: push token

type: string

This policy configures if push tokens are allowed to poll the server for open
challenges (e.g. when the the third-party push service is unavailable or
unreliable).

The following options are available:

``allow``

    *Allow* push tokens to poll for challenges.

``deny``

    *Deny* push tokens to poll for challenges. This basically returns a ``403``
    error when requesting the poll endpoint.

``token``

    *Allow* / *Deny* polling based on the individual token. The tokeninfo key
    ``polling_allowed`` is checked. If the value evaluates to ``False``, polling
    is denied for this token. If it evaluates to ``True`` or is not set, polling
    is allowed for this token.

The default is to ``allow`` polling

.. _policy_challenge_text:

challenge_text, challenge_text_header, challenge_test_footer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: Challenge Text Policy

Using these policies the administrator can modify the challenge texts
of e.g. Email-Token or SMS-Token. The action *challenge_text* changes the
challenge text in general, no matter which challenge response token is used.

If the *challenge_text_header* is set and if there are more matching
challenge response tokens, then the texts of all tokens are
concatenated together. Double challenge texts are reduced to one text only.

The *challenge_text_header* and *challenge_text_footer* may contain HTML.
If the *challenge_text_header* ends with an ``<ul>`` or ``<ol>``, then
all the challenge texts are formatted as an ordered or unordered list.
In this case the *challenge_text_footer* also should contain the closing
tag.

.. note:: The footer will only be used, if the header is also set.

.. _policy_indexedsecret:

indexedsecret_challenge_text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Indexed Secret Token asks the user to provide the characters of the
secret from certain positions. The default text is:

*Please enter the position 3,1,6,7 from your secret.*

with *3,1,6,7* being the positions of the characters, the user is supposed to
enter. This text can be changed with this policy setting.
The text needs to contain the python formatting tag *{0!s}* which will
be replaced with the list of the requested positions.

For more details of this token type see :ref:`indexedsecret_token`.

indexedsecret_count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Indexed Secret Token asks the used for a number of characters from
a shared secret. The default number to ask is 2.

The number of requested positions can be changed using this policy.


.. _policy_webauthn_authn_allowed_transports:

webauthn_allowed_transports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This action determines, which transports may be used to communicate with the
authenticator, during authentication. For instance, if the authenticators used
support both an USB connection and NFC wireless communication, they can be
limited to USB only using this policy. The allowed transports are given as a
space-separated list.

The default is to allow all transports (equivalent to a value of `usb ble nfc
internal`).

.. _policy_webauthn_authn_timeout:

webauthn_timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: integer

This action sets the time in seconds the user has to confirm an authentication
request on his WebAuthn authenticator.

This is a client-side setting, that governs how long the client waits for the
authenticator. It is independent of the time for which a challenge for a
challenge response token is valid, which is governed by the server and
controlled by a separate setting. This means, that if you want to increase this
timeout beyond two minutes, you will have to also increase the challenge
validity time, as documented in :ref:`challenge_validity_time`.

This setting is a hint. It is interpreted by the client and may be adjusted by
an arbitrary amount in either direction, or even ignored entirely.

The default timeout is 60 seconds.

.. note:: If you set this policy you may also want to set
    :ref:`policy_webauthn_enroll_timeout`.

.. _policy_webauthn_authn_user_verification_requirement:

webauthn_user_verification_requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This action configures whether the user's identity should be checked when
authenticating with a WebAuthn token. If this is set to required, any user
signing in with their WebAuthn token will have to provide some form of
verification. This might be biometric identification, or knowledge-based,
depending on the authenticator used.

This defaults to `preferred`, meaning user verification will be performed if
supported by the token.

.. note:: User verification is different from user presence checking. The
    presence of a user will always be confirmed (by asking the user to take
    action on the token, which is usually done by tapping a button on the
    authenticator). User verification goes beyond this by ascertaining, that the
    user is indeed the same user each time (for example through biometric
    means), only set this to `required`, if you know for a fact, that you have
    authenticators, that actually support some form of user verification (these
    are still quite rare in practice).

.. note:: If you configure this, you will likely also want to configure
    :ref:`policy_webauthn_enroll_user_verification_requirement`.


question_number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: integer

The questionnaire token can ask more than one question during one authentication process.
It will ask the first question, verify the answer, ask the next question and verify the answer.
This policy setting defines how many questions the user needs to answer. (default: 1)

.. note:: A question will be asked only once, unless the policy requires more questions to be asked,
   than the token has available answers.
