Event Handler
=============

Added in version 2.12.

What is the difference between :ref:`policies` and event handlers?

Policies are used to define the behaviour of the system. With policies you
can *change* the way the system reacts.

With event handlers you do not change the way the system reacts. But on
certain events you can *trigger a new action* in addition to the behaviour
defined in the policies.

These additional actions are also logged to the audit log. These actions are
marked as *EVENT* in the audit log and you can see, which event triggered
these actions. Thus a single API call can cause several audit log entries:
One for the API call and more for the triggered actions.

Events
------

Each **API call** is an **event** and you can bind arbitrary actions to each
event as you like. You can bind several actions to one event. These actions are executed
in the order of the priority one after another.

.. Note:: An action, that is triggered by an event can not trigger a new action. Only **events** (API calls)
   can trigger actions. E.g. if you are using the :ref:`tokenhandler` to create a new token, the creation
   of the token is an *action*, not an *event*. This means this creation of the token can *not* trigger a new
   action. For more complex actions, you might need to look into the :ref:`scripthandler`.

Internally events are marked by a decorator "event" with an *event identifier*.
At the moment not all events might be tagged. Please drop us a note to tag
all further API calls.

Pre and Post Handling
---------------------

.. index:: Pre Handling, Post Handling

Added in Version 2.23.

With most event handlers you can decide if you want the action to be taken before the actual event or
after the actual event. I.e. if all conditions would trigger certain actions the action is either triggered
before (*pre*) the API request is processed or after (*post*) the request is processed.

Up to version 2.22 all actions where triggered after the request.
In this case additional information from the response is available. E.g. if a user successfully authenticated the
event will know the serial number of the token, which the user used to authenticate.

If the action is triggered before the API request is processed, the event can not know if the authentication request
will be successful or which serial number a token would have.
However, triggering the action *before* the API request is processed can have some interesting other advantages:

Example for Pre Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administrator can define an event definition that would trigger on the event ``validate/check`` in case the
the authenticating user does not have any token assigned.

The *pre* event definition could call the Tokenhandler with the *enroll* action and enroll an email token with
*dynamic_email* for this very user.

When the API request ``validate/check`` is now processed, the user actually now has an email token and can authenticate
via challenge response with this very email token without an administrator ever enrolling or assigning a token for this
user.

.. _handlermodules:

Handler Modules and Actions
---------------------------

.. index:: Handler Modules, Actions

The actions are defined in handler modules. So you bind a handler module and
the action, defined in the handler module, to the events.

The handler module can define several actions and each action in the handler
module can require additional options.

   :width: 500

   *The event* sendmail *requires the option* emailconfig.

.. _handlerconditions:

Conditions
----------

.. index:: Event Handler, conditions

Added in version 2.14

An event handler module may also contain conditions. Only if all conditions
are fulfilled, the action is triggered. Conditions are defined in the class
property *conditions* and checked in the method *check_condition*. The base class
for event handlers currently defines those conditions. So all event handlers come with
the same conditions.

.. note:: In contrast to other conditions, the condition checking for
   ``tokenrealms``, ``tokenresolvers``, ``serial`` and ``user_token_number``
   also evaluates to *true*, if this information
   can not be checked. I.e. if a request does not contain a *serial* or if the serial
   can not be determined, this condition will be evaluated as fulfilled.

   Event Handlers are a mighty and complex tool to tweak the functioning of your
   privacyIDEA system. We recommend to test your definitions thoroughly to assure
   your expected outcome.

Basic conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic event handler module has the following conditions.

**client_ip**

The action is triggered if the client IP matches this value. The value can be a comma-separated list
of single addresses or networks. To exclude entries, put a minus
sign::

  192.168.0.0/24,-192.168.0.12,10.0.0.2

**count_auth**

This can be '>100', '<99', or '=100', to trigger the action, if the tokeninfo field 'count_auth'
is bigger than 100, less than 99 or exactly 100.

**count_auth_fail**

This can be '>100', '<99', or '=100', to trigger the action, if the difference between
the tokeninfo field 'count_auth' and 'count_auth_success is bigger than 100,
less than 99 or exactly 100.

**count_auth_success**

This can be '>100', '<99', or '=100', to trigger the action, if the tokeninfo field
'count_auth_success' is bigger than 100, less than 99 or exactly 100.

**failcounter**

This is the ``failcount`` of the token. It is increased on failed authentication
attempts. If it reaches ``max_failcount`` increasing will stop and the token is locked.
See :term:`failcount`.

The condition can be set to '>9', '=10', or '<5' and it will trigger the action accordingly.

**detail_error_message**

This condition checks a regular expression against the ``detail`` section in
the API response. The field ``detail->error->message`` is evaluated.

Error messages can be manyfold. In case of authentication you could get error
messages like:

"The user can not be found in any resolver in this realm!"

With ``token/init`` you could get:

"missing Authorization header"

.. note:: The field ``detail->error->message is only available in case of an
   internal error, i.e. if the response status is ``False``.

**detail_message**

This condition checks a regular expression against the ``detail`` section in
the API response. The field ``detail->message`` is evaluated.

Those messages can be manyfold like::

    "wrong otp pin"
    "wrong otp value"
    "Only 2 failed authentications per 1:00:00"

.. note:: The field ``detail->message`` is available in case of status ``True``,
   like an authentication request that was handled successfully but failed.

**detail_message**

Here you can enter a regular expression. The condition only applies if the regular
expression matches the ``detail->message`` in the response.

**last_auth**

This condition checks if the last authentication is older than the specified
time delta. The timedelta is specified with "h" (hours), "d" (days) or "y"
(years). Specifying ``180d`` would mean, that the action is triggered if the
last successful authentication with the token was performed more than 180
days ago.

This can be used to send notifications to users or administrators to inform
them, that there is a token, that might be orphaned.

**logged_in_user**

This condition checks if the logged in user is either an administrator or a
normal user. This way the administrator can bind actions to events triggered
by normal users or e.g. by help desk users. If a help desk user enrolls a
token for a user, the user might get notified.

If a normal user enrolls some kind of token, the administrator might get
notified.

**otp_counter**

The action is triggered, if the otp counter of a token has reached the given
value. The value can either be an exact match or greater ('>100') or less ('<200')
then a specified limit.

The administrator can use this condition to e.g. automatically enroll a new
paper token for the user or notify the user that nearly all OTP values of a
paper token have been spent.

**realm**

The condition *realm* matches the user realm. The action will only trigger,
if the user in this event is located in the given realm.

This way the administrator can bind certain actions to specific realms. E.g.
some actions will only be triggered, if the event happens for normal users,
but not for users in admin- or helpdesk realms.

**resolver**

The resolver of the user, for which this event should apply.

**result_status**

The result.status within the response is True or False.

**result_value**

This condition checks the result of an event.

E.g. the result of the event *validate_check* can be a failed authentication.
This can be the trigger to notify either the token owner or the administrator.

**result_authentication**

This checks the entry `result->authentication` in the response.
Possible values are "ACCEPT", "REJECT", "DECLINED" and "CHALLENGE".
It is an enhancement to `result_value`.
If `result_value` is *true*, the `result_authentication` will be "ACCEPT".
If `result_value` is *false*, the `result_authentication` can be "CHALLENGE", "REJECT" or "DELINCED".

**rollout_state**

This is the rollout_state of a token. A token can be rolled out in several steps
like the 2step HOTP/TOTP token. In this case the attribute "rollout_state" of the
token contains certain values like ``clientwait`` or ``enrolled``.
This way actions can be triggered, depending on the step during an enrollment
process.

**serial**

The action will only be triggered, if the serial number of the token in the
event does match the regular expression.

This is a good idea to combine with other conditions. E.g. only tokens with a
certain kind of serial number like Google Authenticator will be deleted
automatically.

**token_has_owner**

The action is only triggered, if the token is or is not assigned to a user.

**token_is_orphaned**

The action is only triggered, if the user, to whom the token is assigned,
does not exist anymore.

**token_locked**

The action is only triggered, if the token in the event is locked, i.e. the
maximum failcounter is reached. In such a case the user can not use the token
to authenticate anymore. So an action to notify the user or enroll a new
token can be triggered.

**token_validity_period**

Checks if the token is in the current validity period or not. Can be set to
*True* or *False*.

.. note:: ``token_validity_period==False`` will trigger an action if either the
   validity period is either *over* or has not *started*, yet.

**tokeninfo**

The tokeninfo condition can compare any arbitrary tokeninfo field against a
fixed value. You can compare strings and integers. Integers are converted
automatically. Valid compares are::

    myValue == 1000
    myValue > 1000
    myValue < 99
    myTokenInfoField == EnrollmentState
    myTokenInfoField < ABC
    myTokenInfoField > abc

"myValue" and "myTokenInfoField" being any possible tokeninfo fields.

Starting with version 2.20 you can also compare dates in the isoformat like
that::

    myValue > 2017-10-12T10:00+0200
    myValue < 2020-01-01T00:00+0000

In addition you can also use the tag ``{now}`` to compare to the current time
*and* you can add offsets to ``{now}`` in seconds, minutes, hours or days::

    myValue < {now}
    myValue > {now}+10d
    myValue < {now}-5h

Which would match if the tokeninfo *myValue* is a date, which is later than
10 days from now or it the tokeninfo *myValue* is a date, which is 5 more
than 5 hours in the past.

**tokenrealm**

In contrast to the *realm* this is the realm of the token - the *tokenrealm*.
The action is only triggered, if the token within the event has the given
tokenrealm. This can be used in workflows, when e.g. hardware tokens which
are not assigned to a user are pushed into a kind of storage realm.

**tokenresolver**

The resolver of the token, for which this event should apply.

**tokentype**

The action is only triggered if the token in this event is of the given type.
This way the administrator can design workflows for enrolling and re-enrolling
tokens. E.g. the tokentype can be a registration token and the registration
code can be easily and automatically sent to the user.

**user_token_number**

The action is only triggered, if the user in the event has the given number
of tokens assigned.

This can be used to e.g. automatically enroll a token for the user if the
user has no tokens left or to notify the administrator if
the user has a certain amount of tokens assigned.

**counter**

The counter condition can compare the value of any arbitrary event counter against a fixed
value. Valid compares are::

    myCounter == 1000
    myCounter > 1000
    myCounter < 1000

"myCounter" being any event counter set with the :ref:`counterhandler`.

.. note:: A non-existing counter value will compare as 0 (zero).

**challenge_session**

The *challenge_session* condition can compare the value of the session attribute of
a challenge against a regular expression. Usual values of the session are:

*enrollment* during a multi challenge enrollment process and

*challenge_declined* if the challenge of a PUSH token was declined by the user.

This way, the administrator can check for declined PUSH authentications and take
according actions to implement PUSH fatigue mitigations like
notifying the helpdesk (see :ref:`usernotification`),
disabling the token or increasing a counter in the tokeninfo (see :ref:`tokenhandler`).

**challenge_expired**

This is a boolean check if the challenge has expired. Each challenge has an expiration
date. If this exceeded this condition evaluates to *True*.

**token_is_in_container**

The action is only triggered, if the token is or is not in a container.

**container_state**

The action is only triggered if the container is in all specified states. The container can have other states
besides the given value.

**container_exact_state**

The action is only triggered if the container is exactly in all specified states. No additional states are allowed.

**container_has_owner**

The action is only triggered if the container is or is not assigned to a user.

**container_type**

The action is only triggered if the container is of the given type.

**container_has_token**

The action is only triggered if the container has or has not at least one token.


Managing Events
---------------

Using the command ``pi-manage events`` you can list, delete, enable and disable events.
You can also export the complete event definitions to a file or import the event definitions from a file again.
During import you can specify if you want to remove all existing events or if you want to add the events from the file
to the existing events in the database.

.. note:: Events are identified by an *id*! Due to database restrictions the id is ignored during import.
   So importing an event with the same name will create a second event with the same name but another id.
