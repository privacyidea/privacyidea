  generated by the Google Authenticator.

**Congratulations!** You just enrolled your first token to a user.

Now you are ready to attach applications to
privacyIDEA in order to add two factor authentication to those applications.
To attach applications read the chapter :ref:`application_plugins`.

You may also go on reading the chapter :ref:`configuration` to get a deeper
insight in the configuration possibilities.
