PrivacyIDEA is a token management system which supports a great variety of different
token types. They each have different requirements concerning configuration and how
the authentication works. This chapter explains the authentication modes, lists the
supported hardware and software tokens and explains how the token types can be used
with privacyIDEA.
Tools which facilitate and automate token enrollment are found in :ref:`enrollment_tools`.
