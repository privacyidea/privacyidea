    This table stores counters of the event handler "Counter".

    Note that an event counter name does *not* correspond to just one,
    but rather *several* table rows, because we store event counters
    for each privacyIDEA node separately.
    This is intended to improve the performance of replicated setups,
    because each privacyIDEA node then only writes to its own "private"
    table row. This way, we avoid locking issues that would occur
    if all nodes write to the same table row.
