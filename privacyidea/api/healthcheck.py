"""This module is intended to ensure the application can be monitored effectively
and provide insights into whether the application and its dependencies are operational.
A primary intention was to create a way for Kubernetes to check on containers.

Endpoints:
    - :http:get:`/healthz/` : Combined health check for liveness and readiness.
    - :http:get:`/healthz/startupz` : Startup check to confirm if the app has started.
    - :http:get:`/healthz/livez` : Liveness check to verify if the app is running.
    - :http:get:`/healthz/readyz` : Readiness check to confirm if the app is ready to serve requests.
    - :http:get:`/healthz/resolversz` : Resolver check to test the connection to all LDAP and SQL resolvers.

The corresponding code is tested in tests/test_api_healthcheck.py.
