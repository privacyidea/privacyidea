# Webui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.8.

## Setup the development environment

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) which comes bundled with the node package manager (npm).

In `privacyidea/static_new/` run `npm install` to install all the pinned dependencies.
If the Angular CLI is not installed globally it can be executed with `npm run-script ng ...` from the `static_new/`
directory.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

To change the privacyIDEA server to connect to, edit the `target` entry in `static_new/src/proxy.conf.json`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
