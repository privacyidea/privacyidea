    <p i18n>The DayPassword Token is a time based password token. It is based on the TOTP token, but it can be used more
            than once.
    </p>
    <p i18n>Here you can define settings, that will be set as default values, when enrolling a DayPassword token. Note
            that the user/admin policies
      <span class="policy-highlight">daypassword_hashlib</span>
            and
      <span class="policy-highlight">daypassword_timestep</span>
            always have precedence over these default values.
