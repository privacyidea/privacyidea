This module implements the communication interface
for resolving user info to the user base

Defines the rough interface for a UserId Resolver
== a UserId Resolver is required to resolve the
   Login Name to an unique User Identifier

- for /etc/passwd this will be the uid
- for ldap this might be the DN
- for SQL the unique index ( what's the right name here (tm))
