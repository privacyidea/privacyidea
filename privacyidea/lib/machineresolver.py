This is the library for creating new machine resolvers in the database and
deleting existing ones.

This module is tested in tests/test_lib_machines.py in the class
MachineTestCase.
Its only dependencies are to the database model.py and to the
config.py, so this can be tested standalone without realms, tokens and
webservice!
