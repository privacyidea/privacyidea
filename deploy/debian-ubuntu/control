Description: two-factor authentication system e.g. for OTP devices
 privacyIDEA: identity, multifactor authentication, authorization.
 This package contains the python module for privacyIDEA. If you want
 to run it in a productive webserver you might want to install
 privacyidea-nginx or privacyidea-apache2.
 privacyIDEA is an open solution for strong two-factor authentication.
